# Travian-Bot

How to use?
Clone the projects to your computer.
Now the bot can be run using command: 
python program.py https://serverurl.domain username password lang 0,1,2
choose your server and place it in serverurl.domain , your username, password, language ("en" for english) and lists to run
The list number should be an array index [from 0 to length - 1].

Usage:
Download python 3.6/ and download selenium using "pip install selenium" command in pip.
Recommended to use with Jenkins which auto builds every certain amount of time.|
My recommendation is to keep the time dynamic, because you can be banned if it runs the same time over and over again.

Note: Do NOT use smart farmlist. use the old one which shows all of the farm lists open when entering the farm lists.
Note: Your current village MUST have rally point to run the farm lists, because the bot enters the rally point of current village.

Have fun!
