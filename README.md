# Travian-Bot

How to use?<Br>
Clone the projects to your computer.<Br>
Now the bot can be run using command: <Br><Br>
python program.py https://serverurl.domain username password lang 0,1,2 <Br><Br>
choose your server and place it in serverurl.domain , your username, password, language ("en" for english) and lists to run
The list number should be an array index [from 0 to length - 1].<Br>
<Br>
Usage:<Br>
Download python 3.6/ and download selenium using "pip install selenium" command in pip.<Br>
Recommended to use with Jenkins which auto builds every certain amount of time.<Br>
My recommendation is to keep the time dynamic, because you can be banned if it runs the same time over and over again.<Br>
<Br>
Note: Do NOT use smart farmlist. use the old one which shows all of the farm lists open when entering the farm lists.<Br>
Note: Your current village MUST have rally point to run the farm lists, because the bot enters the rally point of current village.<Br>
<Br>
Have fun!<Br>
